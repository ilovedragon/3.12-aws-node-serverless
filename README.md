# 3.12-aws-node-serverless

## Brief
The objective of this assignment is to set up a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for a Node.js application that is deployed on a serverless platform.

## Instructions:
Create a new Node.js application using the Express framework.
Set up automatic testing for the application using a testing framework such as Jest or Mocha.
Create a code repository for the application on a version control system such as Git.
Set up a CI/CD pipeline using a tool such as Github Action, Jenkins, Travis CI, or CircleCI.
Configure the pipeline to automatically build and test the code whenever changes are pushed to the code repository.
Deploy the application to a serverless platform such as AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions.
Configure the pipeline to automatically deploy the code to the serverless platform whenever changes are pushed to the code repository and all tests pass.
Write a documentation explaining the steps you have done, including the tools and services used.

## Deliverables:
The Node.js application with automatic testing set up
Code repository with the CI/CD pipeline configured
Documentation explaining the steps taken to set up the pipeline.
